		<span>Research Interests</span>
		<p>My current interests are in hard condensed matter physics. My interest in theoretical condensed matter physics is related to how 	      			fundamental questions can arise with increasing complexity in systems and new laws and generalisations are required to explain them. Another 			aspect that has drawn me towards this field is the possibility of close collaboration with experimental groups. It is an integral part of the 			way I had envisioned myself as a researcher. </p>

		<span>Computational Investigation of the Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations.</span>
		<ul>
			<li> I numerically solved the Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations using the Chebyshev spectral methods.</li>
			<li> Spectral methods usually have more accuracy compared to finite difference methods for small lattices. I was able to show the faster 		 			 convergence and the 2D seperation of phases for the Allen-Cahn equation.</li>
			<li>The results for Cahn-Hilliard equation were however inconclusive. There was no significant increase in accuracy 		using 					 Chebyshev Polynomials and this can perhaps be linked to the fourth derivative present in the equation.</li>
