		My current interests are in hard condensed matter physics. My interest in theoretical condensed matter physics is related to how 	      			fundamental questions can arise with increasing complexity in systems and new laws and generalisations are required to explain them.My    			appreciation of this comes mostly from reading Phillip Anderson's article and the recently published biography on him by Zangwill. Another 			aspect that has drawn me towards this field is the possibility of close collaboration with experimental groups. It is an integral part of the 			way I had envisioned myself as a researcher.

	    During my Bachelors in Science (B. Sc.) I worked on a project under one of my professors, Amit Kumar Bhattacharjee on solving
		the Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations using the Chebyshev spectral methods. The usual method for solving partial differential equations 			as taught in the coursework were finite difference methods, which consists of taking an equidistant n-point grid and approximating the 			function using overlapping low order polynomials. While the accuracy increases on increasing n, the resulting computation requires a lot more 			time and memory. Since the equations are nonlinear, better accuracy can be achieved by using the Chebyshev Polynomials as global basis 			functions on a grid of Chebyshev points. This allows us to achieve a higher accuracy using the same n number of points because the order of 		polynomials also increases with n. I could show the increase in accuracy and also the separation of a 2D system into two phases starting from 			a random initial condition. The results for Cahn-Hilliard equation were however inconclusive. There was no significant increase in accuracy 		using Chebyshev Polynomials and this can perhaps be linked to the fourth derivative present in the equation.
